                "A pleasure to meet thee, Tarnished. I am the witch Renna.",
                "I'd heard tell of a Tarnished hurtling about atop a spectral steed. Thou'rt possessed of the power, no? To call forth the spectral steed named Torrent.",
                "I was entrusted this, for thee. By Torrent's former master. 'Tis a bell for calling forth spirits. Summon them with it, from ash unreturned to the Erdtree. The spirits will obey thine command but briefly, as they recall battles past. Now it is thine. To do with as thou wishest.",
                "How long will it be, I wonder... Before the Tarnished tire of obesiance to the Two Fingers?",
                "Quite the stubborn one, aren't we? Wise, in a way. The Lands Between are home to liars and cheats aplenty. Perhaps thine ample mistrust will be to thy benefit.",
                "No sense in arguing, I see. Thou'rt a wild one, indeed. Torrent hath quite the ruffian chosen...",
                "Upon my name as Ranni the Witch. Mother's rich slumber shall not be disturbed by thee. Foul trespasser. Send word far and wide. Of the last Queen of Caria, Rennala of the Full Moon. And the majesty of the night she conjureth.",
                "Oh, again we cross paths. I believe I said my name was Renna, when last we met. It pleaseth me to see Torrent hale and hearty... But Tarnished, what business hast thou here? I have no memory of inking thee an invitation.",
                "I see. Quite the sleuth, aren't we. Indeed, I am the witch Ranni. I stole a fragment of the Rune of Death, and used it to forge the godslaying black knives through fearsome rite. I did it all.",
                "Oh, is that so? Thou wouldst render me aid, is that thy proposal?",
                "Very well... There's nothing wrong with a well-laid scheme. What's more, if my past and past wounds beckon to thee, I am curious enough to see what thy destiny portends...I'll allow it. Enter my service. And good hunting to thee.",
                "There is, in my service, a half-wolven warrior by the name of Blaidd. I would have thee join him in searching for the hidden treasure of Nokron, the Eternal City.",
                "Ah, allow me to forewarn thee. I shall soon enter my slumber. And it will be some time before I wake. This doll's body is not without its hindrances... Still, I have high hopes for thee. I look forward to the good news when I arise.",
                "Wilt thou enter into my service? I am the witch Ranni. I stole Death long ago, and search now for the dark path. That I might one day upend the whole of it, and rid the world of all that came before. Well? Has that roused thy interest?",
                "To think such was thy plot. Well, I refuse to indulge thy fantasies. I relinquished a natural death long, long ago.",
                "It is in thy possession, is it not? The hidden treasure of Nokron? My thanks. Finally, all the pieces are in place. Soon must I begin my journey. Upon the dark path only I may tread.",
                "A strange gift, perhaps, but a rare sort such as thee would welcome it, I am sure. I am certain now, fate steered us to our reunion. I must thank Torrent too, for his part. You may leave now. It was but brief, but thou gavest me fine service.",
                "Oh? A dogged fellow, aren't we? Or is it merely thy habit, to talk to dolls?",
                "Let us speak of the past, a while. I was once an Empyrean. Of the demigods, only I, Miquella, and Malenia could claim that title. Each of us was chosen by our own Two Fingers, as a candidate to succeed Queen Marika, to become the new god of the coming age.",
                "I would not acquiesce to the Two Fingers. I stole the Rune of Death, slew mine own Empyrean flesh, casting it away. I would not be controlled by that thing.",
                "Blaidd, and Iji both... Art willing to give too much to me. Yet they both understand. What lieth beyond the dark path... That I must betray everything, and rid the world of what came before. Ah, should I add thee to the list? Another one, kind of heart. As kind of heart as they.",
                "O Shadow, thou'rt the last. Tell the Two Fingers, That Ranni the Witch cometh, to rend thy flesh. With a fateful wound, ne'er to heal.",
                "Beautifully fought. My Thanks. 'Twas more of a challenge than I envisioned. Now I can finally stand before them. This is farewell, my dear. Tell Blaidd, and Iji... I love them.",
                "So, it was thee, who would become my Lord. Perhaps I needn't have warned thee. I am pleased, however. Thou'rt a fitting choice. ",
                "Mine will be an order not of gold, but the stars and moon of the chill night. I would keep them far from the earth beneath our feet. As it is now, life, and souls, and order are bound tightly together, but I would have them at great remove.",
                "Wouldst thou come to me, even now, my one and only lord?",
                "Now cometh the age of the stars. A thousand year voyage under the wisdom of the Moon. Here beginneth the chill night that encompasses all, reaching the great beyond. Into fear, doubt, and loneliness... As the path stretcheth into darkness.",
                "Well then. Shall we? My dear consort, eternal."

                    "Then it's settled. Summon me by grace to turn runes into strength. Ahh, another matter. I bequeath to you this ring. Use it to traverse great distances. It will summon a spectral steed named Torrent. Torrent has chosen you. Treat him with respect.",
                    "This tiny golden aura is the grace of the Erdtree. This light once shone in the eyes of your Tarnished brethren. But now it is all that guides you. Or so I hear. The rays of grace, that guide you through your burden.",
                    "Upon the cliff, in Castle Stormveil, is a shardbearer. A demigod who inherited a fragment of the shattered Elden Ring. If the rays of grace signal the castle, then the Elden Ring beckons you. As an ally by pact, I pray that you are fit to face the challenge presented by the Ring.",
                    "Shall I turn your runes to strength? Let my hand rest upon you, for but a moment.",
                    "Share them with me, your thoughts, your ambitions, the principles you would follow.",
                    "Me, I'm searching for my purpose given to me by my mother inside the Erdtree long ago, for the reason that I yet live, burned and bodyless.",
                    "There is something for which I must apologize. I've acted the finger maiden yet I can offer no guidance, I am no maiden. My purpose was long ago lost...",
                    "Spoken echoes of Queen Marika linger here, as well. Shall I share them with you?",
                    "Very well. In Marika's own words. My Lord, and thy warriors. I divest each of thee of thy grace. With thine eyes dimmed, ye will be driven from the Lands Between. Ye will wage war in a land afar, where ye will live, and die.",
                    "In Marika's own words. Then, after thy death, I will give back what I once claimed. Return to the Lands Between, wage war, and brandish the Elden Ring. Grow strong in the face of death. Warriors of my lord. Lord Godfrey.",
                    "The Erdtree governs all. The choice is thine. Become one with the Order. Or divest thyself of it. To wallow at the fringes; a powerless upstart.",
                    "I declare mine intent, to search the depths of the Golden Order. Through understanding of the proper way, our faith, our grace, is increased. Those blissful early days of blind belief are long past. My comrades; why must ye falter?",
                    "Forgive me. I've been...testing you. To see whether or not grace truly does guide you. And...whether you are fit to face the challenge that entails. It seems my worries were unfounded.",
                    "Torrent had your measure from the very start. Whereas I merely pretended.",
                    "There is but one other thing I can do to offer you guidance. I can take you to the Roundtable Hold... Gathering place of Tarnished champions, guided by Grace...",
                    "Very well. Let my hand rest upon you, for but a moment.",
                    "Farewell. I shall leave Torrent, and the power to turn runes into strength, here with you. I wish you luck, in realising your ambition. You have fought long and hard. I have no doubt you will become Elden Lord. May you take the throne.",
                    "I'd like you to undertake a new journey, with me. To the flame of ruin, far above the clouds, upon the snow mountaintops of the giants. The I can set the Erdtree aflame. And guide you. Down the path to becoming Elden Lord.",
                    "However ruined this world has become, however mired in torment and despair, life endures. Births continue. There is beauty in that, is there not? If you would become Lord, do not deny this notion. Please, leave the Frenzied Flame alone.",
                    "I ask you, one more time. Please, seek not the Frenzied Flame. As one who strives to become a Lord, deny not the lives, the new births of this world. Those who would are not fit to be called Lord. When the land they preside over is lifeless.",
                    "Please put a stop to this madness. The Lord of Frenzied Flame is no lord at all. When the land they preside over is lifeless.",

                    "We are almost there. The flame of ruin lies just ahead. I'm glad it was you I traveled with. I must tender my thanks to Torrent, too. Thank you, Torrent. Please continue to lend your aid. Till the end.",
